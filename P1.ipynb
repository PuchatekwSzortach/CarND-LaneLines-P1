    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "- Any glares in the camera would likely wreck havoc with results\n",
    "- Algorith would get totally confused in parkings and other areas without lanes - essentially it assumes there always is a lane and as such picks up anything that looks like a lane line to it - in short anything that represents a line. A trailer standing in a parking lot at a right angle would be reported as a line\n",
    "- I added code to draw green lane between found lane lines, since it looks really cool, but whenever one (or both) lane lines are not correctly found, plotted lane is a total rubbish\n",
    "- in short algorithm has no knowledge of what constitutes a lane line - it just looks for lines that follow probable lane direction. It would be great to let it differentiate a line that has nothing to do with road markings from relevant lines/road features\n"
